# Miniproject_Python

#What is the program about? 
- To find out excel files which hare placed in different directories (minimum 4 directory) and  access path from code which is autommated (i.e not hard coded) from which master file should get the data from all excel files which is created in combined sheets in one file name auto5sheets.xlsx and from that data will be collected and new file openfyxl.xlsx is generated in which all data will be present realted to the inputs given by the user.


#How to run/execute the program and extract results from the repository?
- step 1:-
open the folder name 3_implementation 
- step 2:-
Download all the data file i.e. all quiz sheets of xlsx format and then they can be put it into diffrent location of user choice for there own convinience 
- step 3:-
Download excelwrite.py code from the src folder and run it any IDE preferably pycharm and vs code 
- step 4:-
After execution the program on terminal it will ask for paths of sheets to be read for finding data although code can read as many sheets as user can give paths of sheets yet  enter choice in between 1 to 5 to examine the code's flow.
- step 5:- 
After step 4 you will be asked to enter the number of data to be find out we can give as many data as we want but we have to give 3 corresponding data which has to be unique so as to be validated by code for copying the data in mastersheet named openpyxl.xlsx **also make sure that all the excel file should be closed while running the code**
-step 5:-
check the mastersheet we can see all the input querries was follwed merge and written in the master sheet
