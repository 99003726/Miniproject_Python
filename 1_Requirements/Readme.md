Problem Statement:

To write program in python to extract data from sheets by giving one or more input and validate them and then to put the whole data of all the sheets of the same in Master sheet. Which will store them


Defining the idea for project :

Customized code is used to read and write data. An excel sheet made by hand containing 5 sheets and one master sheet. Here we search for the details of the person associated with the specific name and registration number on all 5 sheets. Once the data has been downloaded from the all sheets it will be printed on the master sheet. All its usage is used to read better search and write file. The code makes studying easier in the field of data science where there is a lot of data that needs to be extracted.



**SWOT ANALYSIS:**

|<p>**Strength:**</p><p>- High Accuracy</p><p>- Reading data</p><p>- Writing data</p>|<p>**Weakness:**</p><p>- Sometimes overwriting of data occurs</p><p>- Difficulty in reading huge data in a single sheet</p>|
| :- | :- |
|<p>**Opportunities:**</p><p>- Has a great advantage in the field of Data Science.</p><p>- Advantageous in merging multiple sheets</p>|<p>**Threats:**</p><p>- Data merging to a single sheet can lead to security issues </p>|
